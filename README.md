Simple Inventory System (Starknet Cairo)
This project is a work in progress implementing a basic inventory system using Starknet Cairo. Currently, it includes the main application logic (main.cairo) but lacks the specific modules for managing the inventory (Inventory.cairo).

Features (Planned):

User interaction for adding and retrieving items.
Storage of item data using a separate contract (Storage.cairo). (Not yet implemented)
Integration with additional modules for managing the inventory details. (Not yet implemented)
Current Status

This initial version focuses on the core user interaction and system coordination logic.

Running the Project (Future Implementation)

Once complete, this project will require compiling the Cairo files and deploying the contracts to a Starknet network. Specific instructions will be added in the future.

Contributing

This project is open for contributions. Feel free to extend the functionality by implementing the missing modules (Inventory.cairo and Storage.cairo).
